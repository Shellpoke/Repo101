Hello Friends! :D

Tempo Temporal




Buenas tardes.

Now let's pretend we did a bunch more work. We have been working all day, but class is almost over.
Another convenient byproduct of storing our project on github.com is that
we can instantly back up our work there and
then copy it down in the future to a different computer.
We will worry about copying down in a future exercise.
But again, let's pretend we need to leave now, so let's commit our current work, 
hen push it up to github.com so we can log off our machine and head to our next class.
